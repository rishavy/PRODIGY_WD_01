A project where I've leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a sleek and responsive landing page. This project showcases my skills in responsive design, user interface (UI) design, and the implementation of interactive features.

## Overview

- **User Interface (UI) Design**: Following design principles, I've created an engaging and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall aesthetic and usability.

- **Interactive Features**: Dynamic elements such as animations and form validation have been implemented using JavaScript, adding a layer of interactivity to the page.
